============

dbConnect vs ORM
----------------
If you have big project then building models (entities) and using
ORM will help you a lot and will be a lot safer.

dbConnect was made as little module to be used in small projects
that need to do some interactions with MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.

It's just a big time saver for developers and helps to keep your
code clean and readable.
